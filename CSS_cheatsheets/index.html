     <!-- first of all DON'T use inline CSS with the 'style' attribute on the element, it will become a mess! 
          remember 'seperation of concerns'! also, preferably use a seperate .css file, not 'internal' css
          where it is stuck in the <style></style> element in your html <head></head> element. that means it
          can't be used elsewhere, PLUS you are needlessly bloating your html file ('external' css) -->

        mixing 'presentation' (the html) with the 'styling' (css) => BAD!! -->
